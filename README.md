# Mobility App

The Mobility App is a Quarkus-based application designed to manage the next step of transportation within the facility. Based on the messages from the `entrance` topic, it decides the mode of transport, either directing individuals to the `stairs` or the `elevator`.

## Key Features

- **Entrance Event Processing**: Captures and processes events from the Kafka topic named `entrance`.
- **Stairs or Elevator Decision**: Depending on various factors, directs individuals to either the `stairs` or `elevator` topics.

## TODO List
- [X] **Process Kafka `entrance` Topic Events**: Capture and process events from the Kafka topic named `entrance`.
- [ ] **Decision Logic**: Implement logic to decide whether a message should be directed to `stairs` or `elevator` topics.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./mvnw package
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/mobility-app-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.
